      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>We believe it is important for our customers and users to understand what information we collect, how we use it and who it is shared with. We are therefore committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how AutoAssist collects, uses, and shares information.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect our current data collection, use, and sharing practices.</p>

<p><b>Third Party Services</b></p>

<p>In addition to the Services we provide directly, we also use third party service providers (collectively referred to as “Third Party Services”) who operate their own Privacy Policies (listed below) and may also provide options to 'opt-out' of data collection. We trust the following Third Party Services and believe they are important to our operation.</p>

<p>So you can find out more about the services we use, we are also providing information on what we use the services for and links to their associated Privacy Policies.</p>

<p><b>The Third Party Services we use:</b></p>

<ul>
<li><i>Crashlytics</i> — for the capture and collection of crash logs to help us identify bugs in our software. The Crashlytics Privacy Policy can be found at: <a href="http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/" target="_blank">http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/</a></li>
<li><i>Apple Analytics</i> — (if enabled by user) for the collection of anonymous analytical data to help us better understand how our customers and users use our Services. App Analytics is covered under the Apple Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/privacy/</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Third Party SDK's (Software Development Kit) and API's</b></p>

<ul>
<li><i>Dropbox SDK</i> — provides us with the ability to upload photos and access data in an AutoAssist app folder. Dropbox Privacy Policy can be found at: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/privacy">https://www.dropbox.com/privacy</a></li>
<li><i>Fabric SDK </i>— provides us with the ability to capture and collect crash logs through the Crashlytics service: https://get.fabric.io/crashlytics?locale=en-gb#Privacy</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Information we collect and how we use it</b></p>

<p>In order to serve you, we collect certain information from you when you interact with AutoAssist.</p>

<p><b>Information we receive:</b></p>

<p>Via Third Party Services:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Usage Information</i> — we collect certain information to better track down and fix bugs including device information, such as unique device identifiers, device type and operating system information. This information does not, however, uniquely identify you as a user.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Information we share and who we share it with</b></p>

<ul>
<li><i>Usage information</i> — Apple Analytics and Crashlytics.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Data Storage</b></p>

<p>All application data (that is the data you create and add to AutoAssist) is only stored locally on your devices. This data is never shared with any other services or people unless you explicitly choose to do so by sharing or enabling automatic sharing of data via the settings.</p>

<p>We have no way to access AutoAssist application data and therefore cannot read, recover or share data for or on behalf of any person or organization.</p>

<p>Data shared to Third Party Services as detailed above may be stored on the servers of the associated Third Party Service.</p>

<p><b>Data Protection</b></p>

<p>We take reasonable measures to protect any personal information we may hold about you in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>

<p>For information on how your iOS device encrypts and secures data please see <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202064" target="_blank">https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202064</a>.</p>

<p><b>Changes to this Policy</b></p>

<p>From time to time we may change our privacy policy and although these changes might be minor we encourage our users to check this page regularly. Any major changes of significant impact to our users will be communicated on the AutoAssist site and in-app. By continuing to use AutoAssist after those changes become effective, you are agreeing to be bound by the revised policy.</p>
